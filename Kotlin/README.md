### Basic

-   **How does Kotlin work on Android?**<br/>
    Just like Java, the Kotlin code is also compiled into the Java bytecode and is executed at runtime by the Java Virtual Machine i.e. JVM. When a Kotlin file named ```Main.kt``` is compiled then it will eventually turn into a class and then the bytecode of the class will be generated. The name of the bytecode file will be ```MainKt.class``` and this file will be executed by the JVM.
